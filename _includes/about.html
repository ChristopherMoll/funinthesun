            The founders of Children’s Fun in the Sun Foundation have perceived a gap
            that exists between the needs of certain terminally ill and children
            suffering from life threatening medical conditions, which is defined as
            any form of progressive, degenerative or malignant condition that has
            placed a child’s life in jeopardy. Only a limited number of these children
            are medically stable enough to travel. All too many find that their dreams
            of a family vacation are unattainable because their medical condition
            requires them to have a properly staffed and equipped medical facility on
            site to manage their ongoing medical issues and needs that can and all too
            often arise out of nowhere. Therefore it is the goal of the foundation to
            raise funds to be used to investigate, purchase and develop a vacation
            destination that has a proper medical facility on site. We plan to target
            our investigations for a location that has a year round warm climate with
            beach and ocean access that is within a (5) five hour flight from the
            NY/NJ metropolitan area.

            Grants and donations will also be made to other 501(c)3 organizations that
            support research towards the cure of pediatric terminal illnesses, those who
            provide healthcare services to terminally ill and children suffering from
            life threatening medical conditions, and to organizations who provide
            support and hospice services to the families of these children.
