The founders of Children’s Fun in the Sun Foundation have perceived a gap that exists between the needs of certain terminally ill and children suffering from life threatening medical conditions, which is defined as any form of progressive, degenerative or malignant condition that has placed a child’s life in jeopardy. Only a limited number of these children are medically stable enough to travel. All too many find that their dreams of a family vacation are unattainable because their medical condition requires them to have a properly staffed and equipped medical facility on site to manage their ongoing medical issues and needs that can and all too often arise out of nowhere. Therefore it is the goal of the foundation to raise funds to be used to investigate, purchase and develop a vacation destination that has a proper medical facility on site. We plan to target our investigations for a location that has a year round warm climate with beach and ocean access that is within a (5) five hour flight from the NY/NJ metropolitan area.

Grants and donations will also be made to other 501(c)3 organizations that support research towards the cure of pediatric terminal illnesses, those who provide healthcare services to terminally ill and children suffering from life threatening medical conditions, and to organizations who provide support and hospice services to the families of these children.
